## What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for its actions and aims to maximize the total reward over time.

## Value-Based Methods

### Q-Learning
Q-Learning is one of the most fundamental RL algorithms. It learns a Q-function that estimates the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state:

```python
class QLearning:
    def __init__(self, states, actions, learning_rate=0.1, discount_factor=0.95):
        self.q_table = np.zeros((states, actions))
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.gamma = discount_factor
        
    def update(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        old_value = self.q_table[state, action]
        next_max = np.max(self.q_table[next_state])
        new_value = (1 - self.lr) * old_value + self.lr * (reward + self.gamma * next_max)
        self.q_table[state, action] = new_value
```

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)
DQN extends Q-learning by using a neural network to approximate the Q-function:

```python
class DQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_size, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, output_size)
        )
        
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.network(x)
```

## Policy-Based Methods

### Policy Gradient
Policy Gradient methods directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of expected reward:

```python
class PolicyGradient:
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        self.policy = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, action_size),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
        
    def get_action(self, state):
        probs = self.policy(state)
        action = torch.multinomial(probs, 1)
        return action
```

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
PPO is a more stable policy gradient method that constrains policy updates:

```python
class PPO:
    def __init__(self, policy, value_function, clip_ratio=0.2):
        self.policy = policy
        self.value_function = value_function
        self.clip_ratio = clip_ratio
        
    def compute_loss(self, states, actions, old_probs, advantages):
        new_probs = self.policy(states)
        ratio = new_probs / old_probs
        clipped_ratio = torch.clamp(ratio, 1 - self.clip_ratio, 1 + self.clip_ratio)
        loss = -torch.min(ratio * advantages, clipped_ratio * advantages).mean()
        return loss
```

## Actor-Critic Methods

Actor-Critic methods combine value-based and policy-based approaches:

```python
class ActorCritic(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, action_size),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
        
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_size, 64),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 1)
        )
        
    def forward(self, state):
        action_probs = self.actor(state)
        state_value = self.critic(state)
        return action_probs, state_value
```

## Implementation Examples

Here's a complete example of training a DQN agent:

```python
def train_dqn(env, agent, episodes=1000):
    for episode in range(episodes):
        state = env.reset()
        total_reward = 0
        
        while True:
            action = agent.select_action(state)
            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
            
            agent.update(state, action, reward, next_state)
            total_reward += reward
            state = next_state
            
            if done:
                break
                
        print(f"Episode {episode}, Total Reward: {total_reward}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Experience Replay**
   - Store and sample from past experiences
   - Helps break correlation between consecutive samples
   - Improves sample efficiency

2. **Target Networks**
   - Use separate networks for target values
   - Update target networks periodically
   - Stabilizes training

3. **Reward Shaping**
   - Design reward functions carefully
   - Consider using reward scaling
   - Implement reward clipping when necessary

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Learning rate is crucial
   - Discount factor affects long-term planning
   - Batch size impacts stability

## Conclusion

Reinforcement Learning algorithms continue to evolve, with new methods being developed to address challenges in stability, sample efficiency, and generalization. Understanding these fundamental algorithms provides a strong foundation for working with more advanced techniques.
